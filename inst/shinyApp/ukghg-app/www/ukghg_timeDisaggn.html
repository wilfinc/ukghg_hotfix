<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A key aim of the NERC Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Feedbacks Programme is to compare bottom-up inventory estimates with top-down estimates from atmospheric inverse modelling, to deliver improved GHG inventories and analyses for the UK. The output required by the inverse modelling groups from “Deliverable D” WP1 is a data set (and/or algorithm) for daily anthropogenic and biogenic emission estimates of CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>, CH<span class="math inline">\(_4\)</span>, N<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O with a spatial resolution of 1 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> for the UK. This provides the prior estimate (spatially- and temporally-resolved) for the inverse modelling, and the bottom-up data set against which to compare top-down model results.</p>
<p>There are three greenhouse gases to consider (CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>, CH<span class="math inline">\(_4\)</span>, N<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O), but the following applies equally to all of them. We distinguish two types of fluxes, which we model separately: anthropogenic (<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>) and biogenic (<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>), and the total flux is the sum of these two components. Both <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> vary in space and time. Spatially, we represent the fluxes <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as two-dimensional grids with 1-km resolution and covering the extent of the UK.</p>

<div id="anthropogenic-ghg-emissions" class="section level1">
<h1>Anthropogenic GHG emissions</h1>
<p>Data on anthropogenic GHG emissions in the UK come from national statistics collated by DECC, AEA and NAEI, and are divided into ten SNAP sectors. These sectors are: Sexpr{sectorName}. For each of these sectors, we have a single spatial map of annual emissions from a reference year (denoted <span class="math inline">\(A_\mathrm{ref}\)</span>), so for the moment, we consider the relative spatial pattern for each sector to be fixed. The modelling applied here extrapolates and disaggregates emissions to time, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, so that we can predict a spatial map of emissions, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, for any sector in any hour, of any weekday, on any day, of any year. Within each sector, the model has the following form:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
A(t) =&amp; A_\mathrm{ref} \times \alpha_t 
\\ 
\text{which can be decomposed to:} \\
\alpha_t =&amp; 
  \alpha_\mathrm{year} \, \times \,
  \alpha_\mathrm{yday} \, \times 
  \alpha_\mathrm{wday} \, \times \, 
  \alpha_\mathrm{hour} \\
\\
\text{where:} \\
\\
\alpha_\mathrm{year} =&amp; \mathrm{f(year)} \\
\alpha_\mathrm{yday} =&amp; \mathrm{f(yday)} \\
\alpha_\mathrm{wday} =&amp; \mathrm{f(wday)} \\
\alpha_\mathrm{hour} =&amp; \mathrm{f(hour)}.
\end{align}\]</span>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> terms act as multipliers representing temporal variation on four time scales: inter-annual (year 1990 to 2016), intra-annual day-of-the-year (yday 1 to 365), within-week-day (wday 1 to 7), and hourly (hour 1 to 24). The sub-annual <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> functions f(yday), f(wday) and f(hour) are cubic splines. The sub-annual <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> functions have an average value of 1, i.e.:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\frac{1}{365}\sum_{j=1}^{365}\alpha_\mathrm{yday}(j) =&amp; 1 \\
\frac{1}{7}  \sum_{d=1}^{7}  \alpha_\mathrm{wday}(d) =&amp; 1 \\
\frac{1}{24} \sum_{h=1}^{24} \alpha_\mathrm{hour}(h) =&amp; 1
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>so they so they decribe the temporal variation around the annual mean. <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_\mathrm{year}\)</span> accounts for the inter-annual variation in the annual mean, relative to the reference year. This model is applied to each sector independently, and summed to give the total anthropogenic flux.</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
A(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n_\mathrm{sector}} A_{i,\mathrm{ref}} \times \alpha_{i,t}
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>There are thus 40 parameters in this model: values of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> for 10 sectors at four temporal scales.</p>

<p>There are different models for the different GHGs - this bit still needs describing.</p>
